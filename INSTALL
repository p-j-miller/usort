This program requires a C99 compiler.
There are normally no compiler warnings (or errors) when compiling these program.

To compile the program under Linux try:
 gcc -march=native -Ofast -std=c99 -Wall -o usort usort.c atof.c heapsort.c qsort.c
 
 
 then ./usort -h to run
 [this has been tested with gcc 9.3.0 under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ] 
 Note as this is a port of the BSD sort command it will be very similar to the sort command already installed.
 
 Under Windows (tested with GCC 15.1.0 compiled for UCRT runtime ): 
  gcc -march=native -Ofast -std=c99 -Wall -o nsort.exe usort.c atof.c heapsort.c qsort.c
   
  then usort.exe -? to run
  
  Note that for simple sorts nsort ( https://github.com/p-j-miller/nsort ) is significantly faster, but usort is a lot more flexible.
  
  There is a makefile and .dev project file created by dev-c++ which should work as long as a recent c compiler (eg GCC 15.1.0 ) is installed and setup in the dev-c++ IDE.
  
USE:  
 See usort.pdf for all the options.
 To sort in numerical order demo1M.csv (supplied and which has 1 million lines) and put the result in sorted1M.csv use:
  usort -gv < demo1M.csv >sorted1M.csv
  
  The file sorted1M-ok.csv is the correct result which can be checked by using (for linux use cmp rather than comp)
  
	comp sorted1M.csv  sorted1M-ok.csv
